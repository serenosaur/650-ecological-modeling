StellaR - A program that uses python to translate Stella models into R scripts

http://www.r-gis.net/stellar/

a) Export Stella model to text format
  Open your model in Stella
  Go to the equation layer
  File -> Save as Text
  Put this text file in your working directory for the project
b) Translate the Stella model into R script
  Open up your terminal
  make the folder containing the stella text model your current working directory
  > StellaR model.txt newname
  The output is in a new directory named "newname"
c) Open the translated model in R, take a look at what you've got
  the script will be called "newname"
  run it all, see what comes out!
  the model itself is defined in the function{} portion of the script
  the "newname_functions" file holds functions that the r script may or may not need in order to run. depends on the model.
  
  
Assignment objectives: 
1) Refamiliarize yourself with Stella
2) Create 2-3 models in Stella (follow examples in textbook, chapter 3) and successfully export to R
3) Upload annotated breakdown of one of the StellaR output scripts
